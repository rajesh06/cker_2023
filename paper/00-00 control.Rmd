abstract: "In [Split the Pie: A Radical New Way to Negotiate](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/better-way-to-divide-the-pie) [@nalebuff2022], Professor Barry Nalebuff of the Yale School of Management proposes an approach for allocating the value created by reaching an agreement. 

The risk sharing created by insurance products creates value through capital allocation efficiency. In our research, we will apply the principles of the split-the-pie approach to the allocation of that value. The analysis will consider the (potential) parties in the value creation: current insureds, prospective insureds, and the insurer. 

We do not intend to contrast the split-the-pie approach with current approaches to profit provisions. Consequently, we do not intend to discuss the merits of the split-the-pie allocation approach. The split-the-pie approach represents a value-based alternative to determining the profit provision in insurance rates. Actuaries may use the research to determine rates and premiums."
